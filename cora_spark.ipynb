    "In this notebook, we compare getML against extant approaches in the relational learning literature on the CORA data set, which is often used for benchmarking. We demonstrate that getML outperforms the state of the art in the relational learning literature on this data set. Beyond the benchmarking aspects, this notebooks showcases getML's excellent capabilities in dealing with categorical data.\n",
